Alien
Hello Rip Van Twinkle. You are probably wondering why I have abducted you.
My people have been watching you humans, and have become interested in a game you call Tic Tac Toe.
I believe I have mastered the game, none of my species can defeat me.
I've become bored winning all the time and came searching for a challenge.
I decided a true challenge would be to play a game with a human familiar with the game!
Please, play Tic Tac Toe with me until you are able to defeat me! If you do, I will return you to where I found you.
