Rip!? Everyone thought you were RIP!
What's happened since you were last here? Well, Mars has reached a point where it could sustain itself.
Soon the colonies here realized they didn't have to follow Earth's demands any longer.
They came here to get away, much like those leaving for America back in the 17th century.
They didn't like the divide between the high class and the low class, and wanted a new life.
Once they realized they could survive without supplies from Earth, it didn't take long for them to declare independence.
Earth of course tried to take back control of the colony, however any ship they sent never made it here.
The crew of those ships later would appear back on Earth, seemingly completely insane and doing nothing but play Tic Tac Toe.
Very mysterious. The colonies here certainly couldn't complain, since Earth quickly gave up.
As far as why everything is green? Well, the atmosphere has been terraformed.
Some scientists came up with some bacteria that loved the old martian atmosphere and output breathable air as waste.
Soon the planet had an atmosphere similar to Earth, and many plants were now able to grow.
As far as my business? As you can see, it's expanded quite a bit!
